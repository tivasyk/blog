не мій текст, не моя подія — але вони позначають якийсь новий етап і у моєму житті: брат від’їжджає до канади. мушу залишити собі у щоденнику на згадку:<br /><blockquote><i>dear colleagues and friends,<br /><br />i want to bid farewell to you all and inform you that today i am leaving my position at dhl express ukraine to pursue other career opportunities overseas. as a number of you already know i am moving to canada (toronto, on) for permanent residence.<br /><br />believe me it was never going to be an easy decision and it surely did not come to me overnight (as our tdi products destined for eu do...). albert einstein once said - “knowledge is experience; everything else is information”. i guess at some point i have decided to gain a new experience and to challenge myself in entirely different environment and see where it will lead me… and as soon as the decision was taken, just like our ceo ken allen says, there ’was no mountain high enough’…<br /><br />i want you all to know that i am leaving here with mixed feelings. excited about new life and career opportunities ahead and sad to be leaving such a great team, company and country. i have enjoyed my tenure here and i appreciate having had the opportunity to work with all of you. thank you very much for the support, guidance, and encouragement you have provided me during my time at dhl express ukraine.<br /><br />this is not a goodbye, only “à toute à l'heure” or “see you later”.</i></blockquote>за братика тримаю кулачки.
