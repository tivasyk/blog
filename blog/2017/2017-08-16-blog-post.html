ех… в коледжі довелося трохи познайомитися з microsoft powershell… що можу сказати: як це розбачити?!<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><b>цитата</b> | <i>«if you are  used to unix and need to achieve some basic scripting task in windows  you may be tempted to explore powershell, as it’s the current “state of  the art” in windows command lines. ideally, don’t: powershell feels like it was built by people who had heard about command  lines a long time ago and tried to recreate one based on stories passed  down through generations of their ancestors. it may well be a powerful  and appropriate tool for windows sysadmins who have taken the time to  learn it. but if you have a unix background and for some reason you do  want to use it, here is what it’s like…»</i> (<a href="https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-woes-of-powershell-8737e5346b1" target="_blank">майк герн</a>)</blockquote>
